# The Wolf Scripting Language

Wolf is an expression-based scripting language aiming to be:

- **Easy.** Wolf lets you bring your own paradigms, and provides the tools to use
them ergonomically.
- **Small.** Wolf is built from first principles by composing together a few, well
chosen features that are easily identified and repurposed.
- **Smart.** Wolf code can be analysed 100% statically with smart inference, so
you don't have to spell things out for the computer.
- **Parallel.** Wolf code avoids prescribing a specific order or method of running
code, so it can be rearranged or broken up across threads for performance.

## `wf` - the Wolf Reference Implementation

There is no reference implementation at this time, and there probably won't be for a while.
