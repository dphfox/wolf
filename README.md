  The Wolf Scripting Language<br>
</h1>
Wolf is an expression-based declarative scripting language, built to be:

- **Easy.** Bring your own paradigms, and use them ergonomically.
- **Small.** Built from first principles with only a few, well chosen features.
- **Smart.** Statically analysable, but doesn't require annotations everywhere.

## The Wolf Book

Visit https://wolf.phfox.net/ to read the Wolf Book, which describes the Wolf 
programming language's design and philosophy.

## `wf` - the Wolf Reference Implementation

`wf` is the Wolf Reference Implementation, a Rust-based set of language tools
which focus on providing a readable implementation, and correctly processing 
Wolf programs.

See the `wf/` directory for more information.

## Contributions

I'm not really looking for contributions at the moment. Feel free to play with
things but this is far from a serious project. I will probably not really look
at GitHub all that much, if ever.
