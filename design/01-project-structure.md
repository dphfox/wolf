# Project structure

Wolf scripts are text files ending in `.wf`.

By default, scripts live side by side in the source directory. However, scripts
may be nested inside of other scripts.

To do this, create a directory with the same name (without the `.wf` extension).
Any scripts in that directory will be nested under the script in the parent
directory.
