The second basic data type in Wolf is `str` - a UTF-8 string of text with LF
line endings.

## String literals

String literals are written in double quotes `"`.

```
""
"Hello, world"
```

## Multiple line strings

String literals can span multiple lines without special syntax. If the starting
line has any indentation, any matching indentation characters are ignored on the
following lines, but extra indentation is still included.

```
"A much longer string.
Strings can span multiple lines."

	"The string might start somewhere along a line that's indented.
	If that's the case, then matching whitespace characters on following
	lines are ignored."

	"However,
		you can still include extra indentation,
	and it will work fine."
```

## Insert sequences

Special sequences can be inserted with `\`:

- `\n` for newlines
- `\t` for tabs
- `\"` for double quotes
- `\\` for backslashes
- `\()` for expressions

```
"This is a \"perfectly normal\" string."

"The answer is \(2 + 2)"
```

It isn't valid to use `\` without one of those special sequences, for forwards
compatibility.

The following would *not* be accepted:

```
"do \ re \ mi"
```

Instead, write it as:

```
do \\ re \\ mi
```

## Raw string literals

Raw string literals are defined with 3 or more double quotes; the number of
double quotes must be matched at the other end.

Raw string literals insert the contents exactly as it appears in the file.

```
"""None of "these" things will \(do) anything."""
"""""""I can even """include""" this raw string!""""""
```

## Count of graphemes

Use the count `#` operator to measure the number of UTF-8 graphemes in a string.

In UTF-8, graphemes correspond closely with individual rendered glyphs,
analogously to characters in ASCII.

```
$ wf -- #"Hello"
5

$ wf -- #""
0

$ wf -- #"ðŸ˜Š"
1
```
