One of the key principles of Wolf is to keep the language as internally consistent as possible and consolidate features together.
The aim is to reduce the number of moving parts that a programmer has to keep in their head when reading a file of Wolf source code, and when constructing a mental image of what the code is attempting to model.

Except for very basic idioms (like, for example, the way math and literals are written), Wolf changes the way common things are expressed to remove special casing. 

Unlike other languages which may attempt to emulate the style of an existing syntax like C or Rust, Wolf is not concerned with how it is presented, so long as the mental model is sound. 
This puts Wolf in a bucket with languages like Lua which don't overtly centre around a certain style.
