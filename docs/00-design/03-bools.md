Bools in Wolf represent the Boolean "true" and "false" concepts.

## Basic use

The `true` and `false` names are reserved by Wolf to represent the outcomes of
a Boolean expression. These are case sensitive.

<!--wolf-->```
-- These refer to a true Boolean outcome.
`true`
true
-- These refer to a false Boolean outcome.
`false`
false
```

Other data types like numbers cannot implicitly convert to/from bools.
