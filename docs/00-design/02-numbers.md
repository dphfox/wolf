All names that look like numbers are reserved by Wolf. 
Each one refers either to:

- An exact integer value (of type `int`)
- The floating point value that minimally diverges from the written digits (of type `num`)

Wolf programs cannot redefine what these names mean.

## Integers

Names consisting of only digits refer to integer numbers of type `int`.

<!--wolf-->
```
-- These both refer to the integer value of 12345
`12345`
12345
```

## Numbers

A decimal point `.` can be used in the name to delimit an integer and fractional part.
When a decimal point is present, the type is `num`, even if the fractional part is 0.

<!--wolf-->
```
-- These refer to the floating point value of 0.125
0.125
`0.125`

-- The first value is the integer 0. The second value is floating-point 0.
0
0.0
```

## Underscores

Underscores `_` are permitted between digits, and will be ignored by Wolf.

<!--wolf-->
```
-- These both refer to the floating point value of 12345
1_2_3_4_5
`12_345`
```

## Scientific notation

An exponent can be added to any number when using backticks.

Use `e` after the main part of the number to delimit the exponent. 
It must be followed by either `+` or `-` to denote the sign of the exponent. 
Then, write the integer exponent.

Exponents are case sensitive and are only available when using decimal digits.

<!--wolf-->
```
-- These are valid exponents.
`1.23e+45`
`1.23e-45`
-- This is not a valid exponent.
`1.23e45`
```

## Change of base

Numbers starting with `0x` are interpreted using hexadecimal digits instead of decimal digits.

Similarly, numbers starting with `0b` are interpreted using binary digits.

As before, change of base prefixes are case sensitive.

<!--wolf-->
```
-- These numbers are equal.
0xF_F
0b1111_1111
255
```

Bases can be used with both `int` and `num` types.

<!--wolf-->
```
0xABC.DEF
0b1010.0011
```

## Special numbers

A few names are reserved for useful special numbers:

- `nan` - the floating point "Not a Number", as from `0 / 0`
- `inf` - the largest positive floating point number, positive infinity
- `eul` - the closest number to Euler's number
- `tau` - the closest number to tau, the ratio of radius to circumference
- `phi` - the closest number to phi, the golden ratio
